# Time Integration

## Theory

The Time Integration module in MonoSim implements numerical methods to solve the dynamic equations of motion for the monopile structure. The implementation focuses on the Newmark-β method.

### Newmark-β Method

The Newmark-β method is an implicit time integration scheme used to solve second-order differential equations in structural dynamics:

```
M * ü(t+Δt) + C * u̇(t+Δt) + K * u(t+Δt) = F(t+Δt)
```

The method uses the following approximations for displacement and velocity:

```
u(t+Δt) = u(t) + Δt * u̇(t) + (Δt²/2) * [(1-2β) * ü(t) + 2β * ü(t+Δt)]
u̇(t+Δt) = u̇(t) + Δt * [(1-γ) * ü(t) + γ * ü(t+Δt)]
```

Where:
- β and γ are parameters that determine the stability and accuracy of the method
- Common choices are β = 0.25 and γ = 0.5 (average acceleration method)

### Effective Stiffness Matrix

The Newmark method leads to an effective stiffness matrix:

```
Keff = K + a0 * M + a1 * C
```

Where a0, a1 are constants derived from the Newmark parameters and time step.

### Solution Procedure

For each time step:

1. Calculate the effective force vector
2. Solve for displacements at the new time step
3. Update velocities and accelerations

## Implementation

The time integration components are implemented in the following files:

- `initializeTimeIntegration.m`: Sets up time integration variables
- `computeNewmarkConstants.m`: Calculates constants for the Newmark method
- `solveNewmarkStep.m`: Solves one step of the Newmark integration
- `initializeForceHistory.m`: Initializes arrays for storing force history

## Validation

*This section will contain validation studies comparing the time integration results with analytical solutions or other numerical methods.*

### Planned Validation Studies

1. Comparison with analytical solutions for simple dynamic systems
2. Verification of energy conservation properties
3. Stability analysis for different time step sizes
4. Convergence studies
5. Comparison with other time integration schemes
